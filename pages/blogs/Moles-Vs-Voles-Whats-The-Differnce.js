          Moles vs Voles: What's the Difference?
        </h>
        <p className="text-md md:text-lg lg:text-lg ">
          Moles and voles are often confused due to their similar burrowing
          habits, but they have distinct differences in appearance, diet, and
          behavior. Hereâ€™s a breakdown to help you distinguish between the two.

              <p>
                Moles have elongated bodies, with velvety fur, small eyes, and
                no visible ears. They have large, paddle-like front feet
                designed for digging.

            <div>
              <h2 class="text-green-700 text-lg font-semibold">Diet</h2>
              <p>
                Moles are insectivores, primarily feeding on insects,
                earthworms, and grubs.

              <h2 class="text-green-700 text-lg font-semibold">Behavior</h2>
              <p>
                Moles create extensive underground tunnel systems. Their tunnels
                are usually deeper and can cause raised ridges on the surface of
                your lawn.

              <h2 class="text-green-700 text-lg font-semibold">Damage</h2>
              <p>
                Moles do not eat plants, but their tunneling can disrupt root
                systems, leading to plant damage.

              <p>
                Voles, also known as meadow mice, have a more mouse-like
                appearance with a compact body, short tail, and small eyes and
                ears.

              <h2 class="text-green-700 text-lg font-semibold">Diet</h2>
              <p>
                Voles are herbivores, feeding on grasses, roots, bulbs, and
                bark.

              <h2 class="text-green-700 text-lg font-semibold">Behavior</h2>
              <p>
                Voles create shallow burrows and surface runways. They are more
                likely to be seen above ground compared to moles.

              <h2 class="text-green-700 text-lg font-semibold">Damage</h2>
              <p>
                Voles can cause significant damage to plants by eating roots and
                bulbs. They also gnaw on tree bark, which can girdle and kill
                young trees.

            <h2 class="text-green-700 text-lg font-semibold">Tunnels</h2>
            <p>
              Mole tunnels are deeper and create raised ridges, while vole
              tunnels are shallow and often accompanied by visible surface
              runways.

            <p>
              Moles eat insects and worms, whereas voles eat plants and roots.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 class="text-green-700 text-lg font-semibold">Appearance</h2>
            <p>
              Moles have specialized digging feet and elongated bodies, while
              voles look more like small, stocky mice.

            Understanding these differences can help you identify which pest is
            causing problems in your yard and take appropriate measures to
            manage them. Schedule your free inspection with a Mole Busters
            technician to get to the bottom of your mole, vole, or gopher
            problems!
