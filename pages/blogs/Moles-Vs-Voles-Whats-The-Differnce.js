        <h1 className="text-green-800 text-xl font-medium">
          Moles and voles are often confused due to their similar burrowing
          habits, but they have distinct differences in appearance, diet, and
          behavior. Hereâ€™s a breakdown to help you distinguish between the two.

              <p>
                Moles have elongated bodies, with velvety fur, small eyes, and
                no visible ears. They have large, paddle-like front feet
                designed for digging.

              <p>
                Moles are insectivores, primarily feeding on insects,
                earthworms, and grubs.

              <p>
                Moles create extensive underground tunnel systems. Their tunnels
                are usually deeper and can cause raised ridges on the surface of
                your lawn.

              <p>
                Moles do not eat plants, but their tunneling can disrupt root
                systems, leading to plant damage

              <h1 class="font-medium text-lg text-green-700">Appearance</h1>
              <p>
                Voles, also known as meadow mice, have a more mouse-like
                appearance with a compact body, short tail, and small eyes and
                ears.

              <h1 class="font-medium text-lg text-green-700">Diet</h1>
              <p>
                Voles are herbivores, feeding on grasses, roots, bulbs, and
                bark.

              <h1 class="font-medium text-lg text-green-700">Behavior</h1>
              <p>
                Voles create shallow burrows and surface runways. They are more
                likely to be seen above ground compared to moles.

              <p>
                Voles can cause significant damage to plants by eating roots and
                bulbs. They also gnaw on tree bark, which can girdle and kill
                young trees.

            Mole tunnels are deeper and create raised ridges, while vole tunnels
            are shallow and often accompanied by visible surface runways.

          <h1 class="font-medium text-lg text-green-700">Diet</h1>

            Moles eat insects and worms, whereas voles eat plants and roots.

          <h1 class="font-medium text-lg text-green-700">Appearance</h1>

            Moles have specialized digging feet and elongated bodies, while
            voles look more like small, stocky mice.
